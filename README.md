notes I make while learning python :D

nothing particularly special, just stuff that I think I may need to remember while programming in python. don't expect them to be annotated or commented well. this is just a self reference for me. don't expect me to upload 24/7.

# installation and compiling
idk just download it as a zip and open it as a project directory in pycharm or something?

# bug reporting
no
